Iterative Construct (LOOP) : Loop is an iterative construct through which we can achieve exection of a particular statement multiple times .In loop iteration (reptition) is performed according to some rules 


RULES: 
initialization
condition
updation

TYPES:
while
do-while
for
for-each

while: also known as entry controlled loop, means condition for execution is checked in the starting;

syntax:
initialization;
while(condition){
//loop body
updation;
}

do-while;
also known as exit controlled loop ,means condition for execution is checked at the end 

syntax:

initialization;
do{

//loop body 
updation;

}while(condition);

FOR:

initialization , condition and updation are written in one line only but the execution is performed same as while loop;
synatx:

for(initialization , condition, updation){
//loop body
}
Shorthand property;


i+=1; i++ ,i*=10 , i/=10;
