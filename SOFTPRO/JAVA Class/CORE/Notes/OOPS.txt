OOPS:Object oriented programming Language:
Abstraction: we can achieve abstraction using interfaces .

Interface store DECLARATION not implementation


Inheritance can be implemented using keywords EXTENDS , SUPER (a keyword and sometimes acts as method)
SYNTAX:

class <child> extends class <parent>


parent class is known as SUPER CLASS/BASE CLASS
child class : SUB CLASS / DERIVED CLASS

Method overloading  : based on number of arguments and data types in methods with same name
Method overriding : inheritance implementation is mandatory






INHERITANCE :
this is a mechanism in which one class can acquire properties of other class .the class who who is acquiring the properties is known as child/sub/derived class where as the class whose properties are being acquired is known as parent/super/base class.the keyword extends is used to implement the concept of inheritance . 
super keyword is used to call the methods or data members / instance variable  from the parent class




POLYMORPHISM:
a mechanism to represent a  data in multiple forms 
1.Compile time (method overloading)
2. Run time  (method overloading)
