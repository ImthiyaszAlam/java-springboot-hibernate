JAVA developed :1991
By James Gosling , in laboratory Sun -Microsystem named Oak .renamed java in 1995;

Token : Smallest individual unit of a program .anything and everything in a program is known as token.
5 categories 

1. keywords : reserved words having predefined meaning.
2. identifier : these are user-defined .eg: calss name,variable name, object name ,method name
Limitations o declare an identifier :
a . should not be a keyword
b. should not start with a digit
c. should not consist of any special symbol except underscore (_) and dollar ($)
d. case sensitivity (small and cap letters are different)

Variables : the entities whose values varies during the execution .variables are the empty box of memory in which usually constants are stored.

3.Literals / constant : the entities whose values are fixed during execution of a program
4.Punctuators /separators: the entities deals with the protocol (rules and regulations) of the program
5. Operators : special symbols used to perform operations among operands (constants and variables )
Types 

i> Arithematic operators (+ , - , * , / , %)
ii> Relational operators ( < , > , <= >= , == ,!=)
iii> Logical operator (AND (&&) , OR (||) , NOT (!))
iv> Assignment operator (=)



DATA TYPE : it define the type of data of a constant which is there in the variable.

pirmitive :
Numeric and non-numeric 

Primitive:
Integer 
byte : -128 to 127 
short : 32768 to 32767
int:  -2b to +2b-1 (2^31)
long (-2^61 to -2^61-1)


Floating point
float
double 



Non numeric 

Character
char 

Boolean
boolean true/false 

Non-primitive / Refference 




PACKAGES : collection of classes ,sub classes and packages ,sub packages and interfaces
package > class > functions(methods)

class jp1{



public static void main(String args[]){
int a  = 10;
int b = 20;
int c ;
c  = a+b;
System.out.println("sum" + c)

}



}

class : a keyword
public : access specifier 
static :modifier
void : return type 
main: function name 
String args : arraay arguments of String type  ,args :identifier String is a keyword 


Access specifier : 
4 types :
public ,private , protected , default
public : Members ( classes , methods , fields ) members are accessible in any class within any package 
private: Members (methods ) are accessible within same class only 
protected : Members methods are accessible within the same package  or in sub classes of different package 
default : Members (classes ,  methods ,fields) are accesible within the same package only 




static : it define the entity is directly related to class
non- static :defines that the entity is not related to class but an instance of a class

System :class
out : object
println : a method of PrintStream class


To compile a java program
javac <filename.java>
TO run a java program
java <classname>



Input ;
.next method : used to take input from user 
Integer --> .nextInt(); for int value
Double --> .nextDouble(); for float values 
String --> .next();    (doesn't include spaces )
String --> .nextLine();

Package : utitlity ---util

classname objectname  = new classname;
new keyword :to create temporary memory
