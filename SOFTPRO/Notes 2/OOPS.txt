Object oriented programming system:
A mechanism of Sd .having four pillars.

1:Abstraction: 
2: Encapsulation
3: Inheritance
4: Polymorphism

Any programming language which follows these four pillars is known as object oriented programming language.

Abstraction:A mechanism to show only essential functionalities and hide all other functionalities of an object(Real world entity having it's own propweerties and functionalities);

Encapsulation: A mechanism to warap up properties and functionalities in a single unit called object.

Inheritance: A feature of OOP .we can create a new product using existing product.

Polymorphism:the term polymorphism means one thing many forms.



CLASS:blueprint of object. collection of variables and methods.
created using keyword "class" followed by class name.the body of class is enclosed within braces'{}'
syntax;
class class_name{
//variables
//methods
}

example:
class 

Constructor:
name as class name 
no return type 
get called automatically at the time of object creation


INHERITANCE:
single Inheritance:
hierarchical Inheritance:
Multi level

single Inheritance:single base class and single derived class
hierarchical Inheritance:single base but multiple derived class


Method overloading:
In java we can create multiple methods with same name in same class but their parameters should be different ,it's called method overloading 
  

Mthod overriding:
rewriting of base class method in derived class .

rules:
1. class must be inherited 
2. base class method name and derived class method name should be same .
3.parameters should be same.
